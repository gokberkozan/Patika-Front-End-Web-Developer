            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>Football is one of the most popular sports in the world. This sport, enjoyed by people of all ages, has some rules.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main objective is to score more goals than the opponent within the match duration.</li>
                <li>Each team consists of 11 players, including one goalkeeper. Matches start with both teams having 11 players each.</li>
                <li>A match lasts 90 minutes, divided into two 45-minute halves, with a 15-minute halftime break. Additional stoppage time may be added at the end of each half.</li>
                <li>Played on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The field dimensions and markings are standardized.</li>
                <li>The game starts with a kick-off from the center circle. Kick-offs also occur after a goal is scored and at the start of the second half.</li>
                <li>A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar.</li>
                <li>The ball is out of play when it fully crosses the goal line or touchline or when the referee stops play.</li>
                <li>A player is offside if they are nearer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent when the ball is played to them, unless they are in their own half or level with the second-last opponent.</li>
                <li>Fouls include kicking, tripping, charging, holding, or pushing an opponent, among others. Serious fouls result in free kicks or penalty kicks, and players can receive yellow or red cards for misconduct.</li>
                <li>Free kicks can be direct or indirect, depending on the foul. Penalty kicks are awarded for fouls committed within the penalty area.</li>
                <li>Throw-ins are awarded when the ball crosses the touchline, last touched by an opponent. Goal kicks are given when the ball crosses the goal line last touched by an attacker without a goal being scored. Corner kicks are awarded when the
                    ball crosses the goal line last touched by a defender without a goal being scored.</li>
                <li>Teams can usually make up to five substitutions during a match, with additional substitutions allowed in extra time in some competitions.</li>
                <li>A referee controls the match, supported by assistant referees and, in some competitions, a fourth official and Video Assistant Referees (VAR).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Basketbol</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a dynamic sport that requires speed and skill. Here are some rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each team consists of five players on the court at a time. Substitutions can be made without limitations.</li>
                <li>FIBA games consist of four 10-minute quarters, while NBA games have four 12-minute quarters. Overtime periods are 5 minutes if the game is tied at the end of regulation.</li>
                <li>Field goals are worth two points if made inside the three-point line and three points if made beyond the three-point line. Free throws are worth one point each and are awarded after certain fouls.</li>
                <li>The game begins with a jump ball at center court. The referee tosses the ball, and players attempt to gain possession.</li>
                <li>The ball can be passed, thrown, tapped, rolled, or dribbled (bouncing the ball while moving). Players cannot run while holding the ball without dribbling (traveling).</li>
                <li>Teams must attempt a shot within 24 seconds (NBA) or 14/24 seconds (FIBA, depending on the scenario). If they fail to do so, the other team gains possession.</li>
                <li>Players must dribble the ball when moving. If a player stops dribbling, they cannot start again (double dribble).</li>
                <li>Personal fouls involve illegal physical contact. Players can foul out after committing a set number of fouls (5 in FIBA, 6 in NBA). Team fouls accumulate, and after a certain number, the opposing team is awarded free throws (bonus situation).</li>
                <li>Common violations include traveling, double dribbling, carrying the ball, and three-second violations (offensive players cannot stay in the key area for more than three seconds).</li>
                <li>Awarded after shooting fouls and some technical fouls. The shooter stands at the free-throw line and has a set amount of time to attempt the shot.</li>
                <li>Teams can play man-to-man or zone defense. Stealing the ball, blocking shots, and contesting shots are key defensive strategies.</li>
                <li>Substitutions can be made during stoppages in play. Players must report to the scorer's table and wait for the referee's signal.</li>
                <li>Each team is allotted a certain number of time-outs to strategize. The number and duration can vary by league.</li>
                <li>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. If the game is tied, an overtime period is played to determine the winner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Volleyball</h2>
            <p>Volleyball is a fast-paced sport where quickness, teamwork, and strategy are rewarded. Here are some rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six players from each squad are present on the floor at once. Every time their team wins the serve, players switch positions in a clockwise fashion.</li>
                <li>The standard format for matches is best-of-five sets. The first team with a two-point advantage to achieve 25 points wins the set. Should a fifth set be required, it is played with a two-point lead and up to 15 points.</li>
                <li>A serve from behind the end line starts the game. In an attempt to spark a rally, the server smashes the ball over the net and onto the court of the opposition.</li>
                <li>To return the ball to the court of their opponent, each side may make a maximum of three contacts. The sequences bump (pass), set, and spike (attack) are frequently used.</li>
                <li>In order to play, players cannot touch the net. Players are not allowed to impede their opponent's play, although they are allowed to reach over the net to block or spike.</li>
                <li>After the opponent loses the serve, players switch places. Players can only be positioned in certain ways on the court during attack, defense, and service.</li>
                <li>There are restrictions on how many times a team can substitute during play stoppages.</li>
                <li>Common violations include: Four hits: A team uses more than three touches to return the ball. Double hit: A single player hits the ball twice consecutively. Lift or carry: The ball is caught or thrown rather than cleanly hit. Net violation:
                    A player touches the net during play.</li>
                <li>There is a cap on how many time-outs each team can use in a set to plan ahead or sabotage the momentum of the opposition.</li>
            </ul>
